# SBM
This project consists in implementing a Stack-Based Machine (SBM). A SBM has a
stack, a memory consisting of ten memory locations (referred to as m0, m1, . . . , m9) and
a program that it is currently executing. We call these programs mini-bytecode programs.
The instructions in the program may manipulate the stack, the memory or affect control
flow.
